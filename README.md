# Do journal reviewers differ in their basic behavioral patterns based on gender, experience, or position?
We present results to further increase the support
for the imperative of universalism in scientific evaluation. This study
constructed a conceptual framework for the manuscript evaluation by
peer reviewers using a textbook model of associative memory and a
salience theory that incorporates the notions of surprise and reaction
to surprise. This conceptual framework determines the reference axis
against which we compared reviewers in evaluating manuscripts by
gender, experience, and position. In our study, we fielded an original
survey to a sample of corresponding authors from seven peer-reviewed
journals. There were 573 respondents. We found that our survey,
which was designed to measure certain constructs (i.e., manuscript
evaluation and disciplinary variations), exhibits satisfactory convergent
and discriminant validity. Then, we tested differences statistically
between reviewers by gender, experience, and position. We found
that when evaluating a manuscript in terms of its contribution and accessibility,
journal reviewers did not differ significantly in their basic
behavioral patterns. However, the interaction between the reviewer’s
memory database and contextual cues may still explain the lack of consistency
between the different reviews for the same manuscript. This
is because a biased set of past review experiences in the reviewer’s
memory database tends to bias their evaluation of the manuscript.
